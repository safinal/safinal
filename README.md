### Hi there 👋, I’m Ali Nafisi

I’m currently completing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Bu-Ali Sina University. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Kurdistan in 2023.

My research interests broadly lie in Deep Learning, with a particular focus on its applications in Multimodal Generation, Trustworthy AI, Program Synthesis, and Reinforcement Learning. My current work centers on debiasing image datasets using generative models.

I’m actively seeking a Ph.D. position where I can continue to grow as a researcher and contribute to cutting-edge, high-impact projects.
