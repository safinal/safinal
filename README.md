### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Ali Nafisi

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Artificial Intelligence at Bu-Ali Sina University and a graduate researcher at the Robot Intelligence & Vision Lab, under the supervision of Prof. Hassan Khotanlou. I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Kurdistan in 2023.

I have broad interests in Deep Learning, with a particular focus on its applications in Trustworthy AI and Multimodal Generative Models. I am also passionate about Deep Learning-Guided Program Synthesis, aiming to develop intelligent systems capable of true invention, adaptation, and innovation. Additionally, I have a strong interest in Deep Reinforcement Learning, which I believe holds great potential for pushing the boundaries of AI beyond human-level performance across various domains.

Currently, my research is focused on Debiasing Image Datasets using Generative Models, addressing critical issues of fairness and reliability in AI systems.

Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and connecting with others in the field. Feel free to reach out!
