### Hi there 👋, I’m Ali Nafisi

I’m currently completing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Bu-Ali Sina University. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Kurdistan in 2023.

My research interests broadly lie in Deep Learning, with a particular focus on its applications in Multimodal Generation, Trustworthy AI, Program Synthesis, and Reinforcement Learning. My current work explores the use of diffusion models for counterfactual data augmentation to mitigate spurious correlations in image datasets.

I’m actively seeking a Ph.D. position where I can continue to grow as a researcher and contribute to cutting-edge, high-impact projects.
