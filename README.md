### Hi there 👋, I’m Ali Nafisi

I’m currently completing my MS in AI at Bu-Ali Sina University. I earned my BS in Computer Engineering from the University of Kurdistan in 2023.

My research experience is rooted in Deep Learning, specifically Natural Language Processing, Multimodal Models, and Trustworthiness. I am now aiming to expand my research scope to explore Neuro-Symbolic AI and Reinforcement Learning.

My current work explores the use of diffusion models for counterfactual data augmentation to mitigate spurious correlations in image datasets.

I’m actively seeking a PhD position where I can continue to grow as a researcher and contribute to cutting-edge, high-impact projects.
