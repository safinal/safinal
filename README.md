### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Ali Nafisi

Iâ€™m currently completing my Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence at Bu-Ali Sina University. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of Kurdistan in 2023.

My research interests broadly include Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, with a particular focus on their applications in Trustworthy AI, Multimodal Generative Models, and Program Synthesis. My current work centers on debiasing image datasets using generative models.

Iâ€™m actively seeking a Ph.D. position where I can continue to grow as a researcher and contribute to cutting-edge, high-impact projects.
